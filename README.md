📌 Project Overview

This project implements a machine learning–based system to predict loan approval and loan repayment behavior using applicant financial and demographic data. The system helps simulate how banks and financial institutions evaluate loan applications and assess credit risk.

The model predicts:

Whether a loan application should be Approved or Rejected

Whether the approved applicant is likely to Repay the loan or Default

🎯 Objectives

Automate the loan approval decision process

Predict loan repayment behavior to reduce default risk

Apply machine learning techniques on real-world financial data

Improve decision accuracy using data-driven models

❗ Problem Statement

Traditional loan approval processes are manual, time-consuming, and prone to bias. Financial institutions also suffer losses due to inaccurate assessment of repayment capability. This project addresses these issues by using machine learning models to make consistent and reliable predictions.

🧠 Solution Approach

The system uses supervised learning algorithms trained on historical loan data. The workflow includes:

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Feature engineering

Model training for approval and repayment prediction

Model evaluation using performance metrics

🗂️ Dataset Description
